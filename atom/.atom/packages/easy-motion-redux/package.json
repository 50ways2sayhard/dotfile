  "readme": "# atom easy-motion (redux) package\n\n> MovementSpeed++. Jump to any word in your current view super fast.\n\n* * *\n\n**Note:** this package is a partial rewrite of the great [easy-motion package](https://github.com/adrian-budau/easy-motion) from Adrian Budau.\n\nThe original package seems dead and, with the deprecation of the atom API pre-1.0, it's sad that we can't use easy-motion in atom anymore. So, i rewrite the package, waiting for news from Adrian.\n\n* * *\n\nCheck out that repository to better understand what this plugin does.\n\n## Modes\n\nBy default the characters used for markers are **ABC....Z**. You can replace this if you want, also from settings.\n\n### Jump to words\n\n**Command:** `easy-motion-redux:words`  \nJump to words.\n\n<img src=\"./caps/mode-words.gif\" styles=\"text-align:center;\">\n\n#### Select to words\n\n**Command:** `easy-motion-redux:words-select`  \nSelect from current cursor position to word.\n\n### Jump to letter\n\n**Command:** `easy-motion-redux:letter`  \nJump to given letter.\n\n<img src=\"./caps/mode-letter.gif\" styles=\"text-align:center;\">\n\n#### Select to letter\n\n**Command:** `easy-motion-redux:letter-select`  \nSelect from current cursor position to given letter.\n\n### Jump to words starting by letter\n\n**Command:** `easy-motion-redux:words_starting`  \nJump to words starting by given letter.\n\n<img src=\"./caps/mode-words-starting.gif\" styles=\"text-align:center;\">\n\n#### Select to words starting by letter\n\n**Command:** `easy-motion-redux:words_starting-select`  \nSelect from current cursor position to words starting by given letter.\n\n## Keybindings\n\nWith the success of Atom, it's really difficult to choose keybindings that will not enter in conflict whit anyone else's packages, so I have removed the default keystrokes and let the keymap empty to let you set your own keybindings.\n",
