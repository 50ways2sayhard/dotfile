In addition to [Atom's official contributing guide](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md):

- Based on "[Readme Driven Development](http://tom.preston-werner.com/2010/08/23/readme-driven-development.html)" preferably create [an issue or PR](https://github.com/viddo/recent-files-fuzzy-finder/issues/new) describing the problem you're solving and why, before you start to code.
- Pull-requests without tests are less likely to be accepted.
